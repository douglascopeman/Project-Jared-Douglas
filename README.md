# Project-Jared-Douglas
N-Body Problem Project

**Jobs To Do**
- Run various benchmarking tests on the functions, try and find areas to optimise
- Sense check and hard check the hamiltonian function
- Display the hamiltonian data in a more meaningful format
- Play around with 3+ bodies in the system, try and get a figure 8 orbit
- 

**Code Refactoring to be done**
- Change simulation from a T by 6 by n Matrix to a T by n matrix of orbit objects containing time evolution of position and velocity
